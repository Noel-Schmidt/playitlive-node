### Why?
---
I built the tool primarily for use with the web radio TubeLive.de in order to easily integrate the PlayItLive API into all projects.

### Installation
--- 

```npm install playitlive-node```

### Example
---

```ts
import PlayItLiveAPI from "playitlive-node";

const playItLiveApi = new PlayItLiveAPI("https://example.com", "abc")

playItLiveApi.getMasterState().then(res => {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(res))
})
```

### Want to contribute?
---

Did I forgot something? No problem, just help us enter the API endpoint!
